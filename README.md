The Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) is an open-source package of routines and example scripts for coronagraphic focal plane wavefront correction. The goal of FALCO is to provide a free, modular framework for the simulation or testbed operation of several common types of coronagraphs, and the design of coronagraphs that use wavefront control algorithms to shape deformable mirrors (DMs) and masks. FALCO includes routines for pair-wise probing estimation of the complex electric field and Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) control, and we ask the community to contribute other wavefront correction algorithms and optical layouts. FALCO utilizes and builds upon PROPER, an established optical propagation library. The key innovation in FALCO is the rapid computation of the linearized response matrix for each DM, which facilitates re-linearization after each control step for faster DM-integrated coronagraph design and wavefront correction experiments. FALCO is freely available as source code in MATLAB at [github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab](github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab) and in Python 3 at [github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python](github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python).

FALCO was developed by A.J. Riggs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology with funding from the Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). Major contributions and testing were provided by Garreth Ruane, Luis Marchen, Santos (Felipe) Fregoso, Erkin Sidick, Carl Coker, Navtej Saini, and Jorge Llop-Sayson.

# Documentation and Support

FALCO is provided as-is and has no guarantee of performance. Nevertheless, reasonable attempts have been made to debug and troubleshoot the code, and the developers are still using and improving the software.

Documentation on specific usage cases is available at the Github Wiki at https://github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab/wiki. Please also look at the example scripts in the falco-matlab sub-directories named 'demo' and 'main'.

For an overview of FALCO and its uses, refer to the SPIE conference paper ["Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) I: A software toolbox for rapid coronagraphic design and wavefront correction"](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2313812). Please cite this if you publish a paper and used FALCO as part of your work.


# Matlab Versions and Toolboxes

FALCO is developed in Matlab 2020b on MacOS. Continuous Integration (CI) is performed with [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/highcontrast/falco-matlab/_build?view=pipelines) using Matlab 2020b on Ubuntu 20.04. We try not to use any Matlab features specific to new versions, but functionality with older versions is not guaranteed.

No paid Matlab toolboxes should be required for FALCO. However, the Parallel Computing Toolbox or Distributed Computing Toolbox can be used to parallelize some repetitive calculations by changing the value of a flag, *mp.flagParfor = true;*. Please email the developer if you find that any other toolboxes are accidentally and/or unnecessarily used or called. FALCO versions of *rms.m* and *sinc.m* have been included since those simple functions otherwise require the Signal Processing Toolbox. Thank you to Jason Kay for reporting the rms issue.


# Installation Instructions

1) You need a MATLAB license and an install of MATLAB. Multi-wavelength simulations may need a desktop computer or server instead of a laptop to run. Monochromatic and/or lower-resolution trials usually run quickly on a laptop with only a few GB of RAM.

2) Tell MATLAB where FALCO is.
  A) You can temporarily do that by defining the variable `mp.path.falco` in each main script or config file you use, or
  B) Permanently add FALCO to the MATLAB path with the commands `addpath(path/to/falco-matlab); savepath;` where _path/to/falco-matlab_ is the absolute file path on your computer for the PROPER directory. The command `savepath` will keep the directory you included in the *pathdef.m* file that MATLAB uses to look for the functions is expects. Note that the *pathdef.m* file might not be writeable on a server without admin privileges.

3) *No need to download PROPER yourself anymore.* PROPER is now included in FALCO (in the *lib_external* subdirectory) so that it is available for continuous integration tests. Just FYI, the official PROPER source code repository is on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proper-library/).


4) Try to run the example script file _EXAMPLE_try_running_FALCO.m_ in the subdirectory *main/*. If the example script runs through with no errors, then the file paths are set correctly.

5) Now go ahead and try some of the other example scripts in _falco-matlab/main_, which start with "EXAMPLE_", again adjusting the path definitions for the FALCO if necessary. For this initial functionality test, in the main script you should set the number of subbands and wavelengths to 1 (`mp.Nsbp = 1; mp.Nwpsbp = 1;`) and turn off the parallel computing  flag (`mp.flagParfor = false;`) for it to run quickly. I recommend finding the script closest to your intended purpose and making changes to a copy of that.


# Version History
v4.3 released on May 6, 2021.
  - All the model functions in the model/ subdirectory were refactored.
    - The HLC cases with an FPM that scales with wavelength are no longer separate functions; they are now just an extra case in the nominally used models.
    - The no-FPM Jacobian calculation was simplified and sped up, and tests were added for it.
    - The no-FPM compact model cases were corrected to fix an energy conservation bug when the Lyot plane had a different resolution than the prior pupil planes.
  - `falco_configure_dark_hole_region()` has been refactored to reduce redundancy. Tests were added for it.
  - Added a function to include noise in simulated subband images.

v4.2 released on April 6, 2021.
  - **Mask generation (or loading) must now be done before calling `falco_flesh_out_workspace()` rather than as part of `falco_flesh_out_workspace()`.** All the example scripts in this repo have been updated to accommodate this small but important change. This makes it more clear to the user what the masks are; they no longer have to know what is inside of the buried FALCO functions such as `falco_gen_chosen_pupil()` or `falco_gen_chosen_apodizer()`, which have been deprecated.  This change covers all mask types used (input pupil mask, apodizer mask, lyot stop, focal plane mask). The two exceptions are 1) vortex masks and 2) hybrid Lyot occulters that are being optimized with DM8 and DM9. HLC occulters that are pre-optimized must still be loaded as before.


v4.1 released on March 29, 2021.
  - Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) using Azure DevOps.
  - Lots of code cleanup and reorganization.

v4.0 released on January 6, 2021.
  - Multi-star wavefront sensing and control capabilities added. This required adding the option to have multiple stars in the compact and full models.

v3.0 released on February 28, 2018. First long-term stable version of FALCO. Re-designed to be expandable for many people's different needs and uses without them having to overwrite each other's features.
  - Wavefront estimation added (pairwise probing with batch process and Kalman filter).
  - propcustom_dm.m added to allow use of different DM actuator influence functions.
  - Config file loaded first in the main script rather than afterward. Makes everything much easier to read and modify.
  - Optical models top-level changed from coronagraph type to layout (i.e., which bench or instrument). This makes FALCO more expandable for different people's uses.
  - Scalar vortex model added from Garreth Ruane.
  - Many changes to syntax and variable names to make code more uniform, simpler, and easier to expand upon.

v2.0 released on October 10, 2018.
  - HLC design capabil added.
  - Many more features added.
  - Syntax changes.

v1.0 released on April 11, 2018.
  - Wavefront control functionality for LC, SPLC, and VC coronagraphs.
